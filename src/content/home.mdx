Hey, Iâ€™m RÄ±dvan ðŸ™Œ Iâ€™m a software developer, foodie, and analog photography enthusiast based in Munich, Germany.

By day, I build web applications as a Fullstack Developer at CHECK24 and pursue my Masterâ€™s at TUM. I previously crafted frontends at Automat Berlin. By night, youâ€™ll usually find me exploring Munichâ€™s food scene or capturing moments on my analog camera.
